RL Baselines3 Zoo Docs - A Training Framework for Stable Baselines3
===================================================================

`RL Baselines3 Zoo  <https://github.com/DLR-RM/stable-baselines3>`_  s a training framework for Reinforcement Learning (RL), using `Stable Baselines3 (SB3) <https://github.com/DLR-RM/stable-baselines3>`_,
reliable implementations of reinforcement learning algorithms in PyTorch.

Github repository: https://github.com/DLR-RM/rl-baselines3-zoo

It provides scripts for training, evaluating agents, tuning hyperparameters, plotting results and recording videos.

In addition, it includes a collection of tuned hyperparameters for common environments and RL algorithms, and agents trained with those settings.
